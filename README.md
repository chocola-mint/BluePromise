# BluePromise

BluePromise implements the Promise pattern for Unreal's Blueprints, allowing users to implement and manage asynchronous logic in Blueprint easily. Similar to Unity's coroutines.

## How to Install

Clone the repository into your project's Plugins folder and build the project.

## Differences from Latent Actions

BluePromise gives the user more control by allowing the user to cancel any BluePromise. This makes managing multiple concurrent asynchronous flows much easier.
